# Campus Navigation System

## Overview

This is a complete mobile-friendly Flask-based campus navigation system that helps users find directions between different locations on a campus. The system provides a web interface with QR code access, step-by-step directions, and multi-floor pathfinding. **Project Status: COMPLETE and READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web application with Python
- **Navigation Engine**: Custom pathfinding system using BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm
- **Data Storage**: JSON file-based storage for campus location data
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints for location data and navigation requests

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templating with Flask
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with dark theme
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for interactive features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with touch support

## Key Components

### Core Navigation System
- **CampusNavigator** (`navigation.py`): Main navigation class that handles location indexing and pathfinding
- **CampusPathfinder** (`pathfinder.py`): Specialized pathfinding algorithm implementation
- **Campus Data** (`campus_data.json`): JSON structure containing floor plans, locations, and connections

### Web Application
- **Main Application** (`app.py`): Flask routes and request handling
- **Templates**: HTML templates for user interface (index.html, directions.html)
- **Static Assets**: CSS styling and JavaScript for enhanced user experience

### Data Structure
The campus data is organized hierarchically:
- **Floors**: Ground floor, first floor, etc.
- **Locations**: Specific rooms, offices, and landmarks
- **Connections**: Graph-based connections between locations
- **Transitions**: Inter-floor connections (stairs, elevators)

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: User enters start and destination locations via web form
2. **Location Validation**: System validates and normalizes location names
3. **Pathfinding**: BFS algorithm finds optimal route between locations
4. **Direction Generation**: System converts path into human-readable directions
5. **Response Rendering**: Results displayed in user-friendly format

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Flask**: Web framework for application structure
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and middleware
- **Standard Library**: JSON, logging, collections for core functionality

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework with dark theme support
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced visual elements
- **QR Code Generation**: JavaScript library for generating access QR codes

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- **Entry Point**: `main.py` for local development
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for session secrets
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for development with detailed logging

### Production Considerations
- **Proxy Fix**: Configured for deployment behind reverse proxies
- **Security**: Session secret management through environment variables
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows for horizontal scaling

### File Structure
- Static files served from `/static/` directory
- Templates organized in `/templates/` directory
- Campus data maintained in JSON format for easy updates
- Modular Python code separated by functionality
